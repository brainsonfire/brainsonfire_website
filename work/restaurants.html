          Author Virginia Woolf once said, “One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.” We couldn’t agree more. At Brains on Fire we believe that when people sit down to dine together, it’s more than a meal. If life is what happens in the stretches of time between breakfast, lunch and dinner, those meals become an opportunity to dot our lives -- three times a day -- by reconnecting the people we love most. In this section you’ll find examples of our identity work. Over the years, we’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with some pretty amazing restaurants. It has been an honor bringing their stories and passion to life. Now if you’ll excuse us, could someone please pass those cheese biscuits? Yeah those -the ones from Soby’s.

        <h3>Soby’s. A Labor of Love</h3>
        <p>
          What happens when an architecture major decides he wants to open a restaurant? If you’re Brains on Fire, you get behind the dream and help bring it to life. Such was the case with Soby’s. A little over fifteen years ago, when Carl Sobocinski decided he wanted to open a  restaurant he turned to friends for help. A visionary at the core, Carl knew downtown Greenville was ready for a high-end restaurant where people felt welcome and wanted to spend time, but he also knew he’d need support to get it off the ground. From the first tours of the old building that used to house a shoe mart to launch day to just last week, we've been there for the long haul. What began as a dream on Main Street ultimately became an open door and a place where visitors and residents alike go to experience true southern hospitality.<br>
          At Brains on Fire our roots are in branding and identity, and over the years we’ve kept that core alive through our association with the folks over at Soby’s. From  naming to custom designed fonts and handwritten typestyles to logos that tell a story, it has been an honor giving Carl's dream an identity and working together to bring a thriving restaurant community to life in Greenville.

        <h3>Now, could we get a little Soby’s on the Side? Please.</h3>
        <p>
          When Carl Sobocinski decided it was time to launch a quick breakfast and lunch restaurant in downtown Greenville, he approached Brains on Fire about helping bring its identity to life. We gladly accepted the challenge. You’ll find the aptly named “Soby’s on the Side” literally on the side of Soby’s. The sunshine logo takes advantage of the “O” in Soby’s, serving as a beacon to those who want to fill the most important meal of the day with some of the most delicious food in town. We also took the liberty of putting a gastronomical spin on “Carpe Diem,” turning it into “Eat’em Diem.” Eat the Day? Don’t mind if we do.

        <h3>It just made SENSE</h3>
        <p>
          When it comes to a great meal, the taste buds tend to get all the credit. But did you know that our sense of smell is 10,000x more sensitive than any other sense? Unlike touch and taste, which require information to travel through the body to the brain, smell is immediate. It has a direct line to the brain, so to speak. Long story short, you can carry on thanking your taste buds, but your nose is really the major player in that “best-meal-of-my-life” phenomenon.

When Greenville restaurateur Carl Sobocinski approached Brains on Fire about developing a name and identity for his new gastropub, we gladly accepted the challenge, eventually settling on the name “Nosedive.” Though it may not be a dive in the traditional sense (you won’t find any worn plastic booth seats here!), it has become a downtown hot spot where people from all walks of life come together to take a timeout and enjoy some really delicious, really unpretentious food in a fun atmosphere.

        <h3>Time Well Wasted</h3>
        <p>
          What’s in a name? A lot. And we’ve done our fair share of restaurant naming over the years. After being enchanted by the laidback Mediterranean lifestyle during a trip, restaurateur Carl Sobocinski returned to Greenville inspired to open a restaurant that would give locals a place to relax, nibble, linger and gather with loved ones to celebrate life. Brains on Fire was hired to come up with a name that would capture the spirit of the Mediterranean and bring the experience stateside. Just like that, The Lazy Goat was born.

        <h3>The Best Seat in the House.</h3>
        <p>
          With five thriving restaurants under his belt, Carl Sobocinski approached Brains on Fire about helping him name his new restaurant group in YEAR. After tossing around several ideas, we came to rest on Table301. Inspired by the best seat in the house at Carl's flagship restaurant, Soby's, you'll still find Table #301 welcoming guests to gather and experience one-of-a-kind southern hospitality today. As a restaurant group, the Table301 name embodies a commitment to creating remarkable experiences and treating everyone like a guest of honor.

        <h3>Meet me at the bridge.</h3>
        <p>
          Not many cities can claim they have roaring waterfalls running through the heart of downtown. Then again, Greenville isn’t your average city. Beloved by visitors and residents alike, Falls Park is a cherished part of the downtown landscape. The Liberty Bridge, a 380-foot pedestrian footbridge suspended above the falls, is the park’s crowning jewel. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more quintessentially Greenville spot in the city. 

At the foot of the bridge you’ll also find a sweet little restaurant space. When the former owner decided to leave the restaurant business, the city approached local restaurateur, Carl Sobocinski, about filling the space. Brains on Fire was hired to give it a name and help bring the vision to life through identity. Today, this unpretentious little French bistro welcomes diners by offering up a great patio, great views and great food. The name? Passerelle. That’s French for “footbridge.”

          <h3>Family Business</h3>
          <p>
            When they say the restaurant business is a family business, it’s no joke. Such is the story of Papi’s Tacos, the newest member of the Table 301 restaurant family. 

Jorge “Papi” Baralles has been with Table 301 from the beginning—all the way back to 1997. A native of Cuautla, Mexico, cooking was a family tradition in Jorge’s family. Everything was made from scratch, with each person adding a little of their own personality to the recipes. This led to a long list of family recipes incorporating many culinary traditions and techniques.

Jorge began his time at Soby’s as a dishwasher, however his love for food and cooking quickly landed him square in the middle of the kitchen prep team. A little secret - Jorge is responsible for Soby’s Signature Garlic Cheddar Cheese Biscuits. Go Papi. 

Realizing that the family had the desire to open a restaurant of their own, Carl Sobocinski, founder of Table 301, approached Jorge about working together to launch a quick service taqueria that would fit into an existing unused space beneath The Lazy Goat. Papi’s Tacos opened in August 2013. The restaurant could be described as a taco truck - only without the truck. The identity Brains on Fire developed pays homage to Papi’s Mexican heritage through lots of hand lettered typography and murals depicting the streetscapes of a typical city in Papi’s homeland.
