									<p>Greg Ramsey ("Ramsey" to friends…which is pretty much everyone) is one of a kind. A true master craftsman of art and design, he has an innate ability to weave compelling, inspirational visual stories out of everything he touches. As a principal at Brains on Fire, Ramsey is intimately involved in all aspects of client brand identities and movements. His ability to bring the concepts and philosophies behind client movements and identities to life is one of the things that sets us apart from other word of mouth and identity companies who fall short.</p>
									<p>Just scratching the surface, Ramsey has designed the lion's share of exhibits in BMW’s North American museum, Zentrum. He also illustrated the children's book, </p>

									<p>“The Red Ribbon: A Story of Hope, for the National Family Partnership,” which received national acclaim and was used as a point of inspiration for President Clinton's War on Drugs. Dig a little deeper and you’ll discover Ram’s design handiwork giving communities like Heroes in Recovery and VisitGreenvilleSC (Yeah, THAT Greenville) a look, a feel, a mark and a visually stunning identity to rally around. </p>
									<p>As much as we admire Ramsey’s design chops (and they’re pretty dang impressive), we love him most of all for the quiet leadership and humble dose of Ramsey-ness he brings to the team. “It used to be about being some design rock star. Now it’s about being a part of this unbelievably talented team of folks called Brains on Fire, and using our gifts to do nothing less than change the world – one little moment at a time.” ‘Nuff said.</p>
