<h1 id="filing-issues">Filing issues</h1>
<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> GitHub is for bug reports and code contributions only - if you have a support question or a request for a customisation don&#39;t post here, go to our <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo">Support Forum</a> instead.</p>
<p>For localization, please refer to <a href="http://translate.yoast.com/projects/wordpress-seo">translate.yoast.com</a>, though bugs with strings that can&#39;t be translated are welcome here.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-write-a-useful-bug-report">How to write a useful bug report</h2>
<p>If you think you have found a bug (we acknowledge that that&#39;s a possibility), please make sure you&#39;re using the latest version of the plugin. If possible check out the latest version from GitHub and see if the bug still exists there.</p>
<p>A useful bug report explains:</p>
<ol>
<li>What you were trying to achieve.</li>
<li>What you were expecting to happen.</li>
<li>What actually happened, illustrated with screenshots if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your bug report should also contain your WordPress version and if there are any errors, the <em>exact</em> error text, including line numbers. </p>
<h3 id="blank-white-screen">Blank / white screen</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re getting a blank screen and you report just that, we can do <em>absolutely</em> nothing. By default, your WordPress install suppresses all errors, to prevent information leaks, but we need those errors to be able to help you. If you apply the small piece of code in <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress-debug/">this post on WP_DEBUG</a> to your site, you should be able to open the URL that gave you a white screen, append <code>?debug=debug</code> to the URL and get the actual error.</p>
<p>That error will help us, without that error, we&#39;re completely in the dark about your white page problem...</p>
<h3 id="interface-errors">Interface errors</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re reporting a bug about specific interface elements not working as expected, there&#39;s probably an error showing in your browsers JavaScript console. Please open your browsers console and copy the exact error showing there, or make a screenshot. If you don&#39;t know how to open your browsers console, here is info for <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Tools/Web_Console">Firefox</a>. For IE, some Googling will help but it changes with every version.</p>
