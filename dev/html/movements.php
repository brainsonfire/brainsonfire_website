							<li data-orbit-slide="headline-1"><div><strong>What is a Brains on Fire MOVEMENT?</strong>Today, the word “movement” is thrown around by marketers to mean anything that can be measured in “likes” and “followers” and “shares.” Movements are not ignited by apps, they are ignited by people. Real people with real names. People interested in more than just winning a contest or promotion. We’re talking about passionate people who are connected and committed to putting in a little elbow grease for something they believe in. People who want to be better people in a better world.</div></li>
							<li data-orbit-slide="headline-2"><div><strong>So why should you CARE?</strong>Because for your company, a Brains on Fire movement can serve as a cultural compass and gravitational force that pulls people together. We believe you are in the business of more than just business and right now, as you read this, thousands of people are waiting to link arms with your brand and do something meaningful.<br >Brains on Fire movements are not about short-term fixes. They’re not about campaigns to wrangle more “followers” or add names to a mailing list. They’re about earning strong connections that transform customers and employees into allies and believers.</div></li>
							<li data-orbit-slide="headline-3"><div><strong>What does it TAKE?</strong>Our movements come with prerequisites. You must believe that your brand serves a greater cause that deeply matters to everyone it touches. You must be willing to structure your organization and embrace a philosophy to consistently demonstrate the highest regard for your employees and customers. And most importantly, you must have a willingness to partner with people, and be brave enough to “be famous for the people who love you.”</div></li>
							<li data-orbit-slide="headline-4"><div><strong>What will it DO?</strong>A Brains on Fire movement will strengthen the health and integrity of your brand by engaging your employees and bringing you closer to your customers. At the end of the day, as you’re scrolling down the list of your company’s most valuable assets, you’ll add a new line for our bond of trust you have earned and the community of supporters who can’t image a world without you.<br> So let us ask you, what is that worth?</div></li>
