								<div>Today the word “movement” is thrown around by marketers to mean anything that can be measured in “likes” and “followers” and “shares”. But we stand by the original definition of the word. We know movements are not ignited by “likes”, they are ignited by people. Real people with real names. People interested in more than just winning a contest or promotion. We’re talking about passionate people who are connected and willing to put in a little elbow grease for something they believe in.</div>
							</li> 
							
							<li data-orbit-slide="headline-2">
								<div><strong>So why should you CARE?</strong> Because for your company a movement can serve as a cultural compass and gravitational force that pulls people together. We believe you are in the business of more than just business and right now, as you read this, thousands of people are waiting to link arms with your brand and do something meaningful.</div>
							</li> 
							
							<li data-orbit-slide="headline-3">
								<div><strong>What Does it Take?</strong> Our movements come with prerequisites. You must be passionate about your brand. You must have a strong commitment to outstanding customer service and a true love for your customers and employees. And most importantly, you must have a willingness to partner with people, and be brave enough to “be famous for the people who love you.”</div>
							</li> 
							
							<li data-orbit-slide="headline-4">
								<div><strong>What Will it Do?</strong> A Brains on Fire movement will strengthen the health of your brand by engaging your employees and bringing you closer to your customers. At the end of the day, as you’re scrolling down the list of your company’s most valuable assets, you’ll add a new line for the bond of trust you have earned and the community of supporters who can’t image a world without you.</div>
