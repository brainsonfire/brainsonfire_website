					<p>In their second book, The Passion Conversation, the word-of-mouth masterminds mash-up the latest in wonky academic research with practical, real world case stories to show how any business can spark and sustain word of mouth marketing.</p>
					<p>Readers will learn how loving your customers results in not just building a thriving community, but also driving meaningful conversations and ultimately impacting the financial success of a business. </p>

					<p>THE PASSION CONVERSATION (published by Wiley) changes your perspective on marketing by explaining the three motivations for why people talk about businesses and causes. It also details how every marketing problem is a people problem in disguise and gives irrefutable evidence that marketing materials are now conversation tools. The relatable case stories show how customer communities sustain word of mouth while also sparking financial impact. A series of exercises called Passion Explorations are included to help your business apply these worthwhile marketing lessons.</p>

						<p>I’m known as the Courageous President of Brains on Fire. I believe happiness leads to success. I have an amazing life, full of goodness and sunshine and adventure. I work with some really smart people I call friends. I’m one of the co-authors of the book Brains on Fire. I love my two kids in a way words absolutely can’t explain. I love the sound of children laughing—of anyone laughing, actually. I love hot yoga, cold beer, sunny days, and starry nights. I believe writing inspires thinking. I love to speak and share our customers’ stories in hopes of inspiring others. I think out loud at www.brainsonfire.com/blog. I believe we all work better when we’re having fun. I expect my business dealings to be profitable. I want to create positive change in the world. I believe love is a circular transaction.</p><p>I try really hard to keep things simple. Some days I’m better at that than others. I am part of the Brains on Fire movement.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="tab2">
						<p>My official title at Brains on Fire is Word of Mouth Inspiration
Officer, but I consider myself more of a pathfinder for our clients
and colleagues at Brains on Fire; and I’ve been down that path with
Fiskars Brands, Best Buy, Colonial Williamsburg, the American
Booksellers Association, Charleston Parks Conservancy, the U.S.
Office of National Drug Control Policy, the National Center for
Family Literacy, Love146, and Rage Against the Haze (South
Carolina’s youth-led anti-tobacco movement). I wouldn’t be here
without a ton of support and love from my family at home and
the Brains on Fire family. I’m lucky to be an explorer in conversations.
I like uncovering the DNA of sustainable word of mouth
movements and building them from the ground up. I’m a blogger.
I’m a talker—you can find me at places like the Word of Mouth
Marketing Association, the Public Relations Society of America,
the American Marketing Association, the NewComm Forum on
research communications, and the Customer Management World
Africa conference. On Saturdays you’ll find me in the spin room at my gym and cruising in my Mini.
</p>
					</div>
					<div id="tab3">
						<p>I take my job seriously, myself lightly. My serious business side is
shaped from being a longtime marketing manager with Starbucks
and later as director of national marketing with Whole Foods.
For many years I operated my own itty-bitty consultancy, the
Brand Autopsy Marketing Practice. Today, I’m happily cooped
up at Brains on Fire, where I help ensure that our clients achieve
their desired growth, and help Brains on Fire develop learners and
leaders within the tribe. Along the way, I’ve solo-authored a few
business books: Tribal Knowledge, a business management book,
and Tough Love, a business book masquerading as a screenplay.
My business travels have taken me around the world speaking
to marketers at conferences big and small. My lighthearted side
involves beer and music. I treat beer like others treat wine (my
beer cellar is proof of that). I’m also deep into funky jazz and jazzy
funk. (Think Sly Stone, Gil Scott-Heron, Meters, and anything
that is “on the one.” Dig?)
</p>
					</div>
					<div id="tab4">
						<p>I’m Chief Inspiration Officer at Brains on Fire, which means
my job is to find inspiration where no one else is looking. I’ve
never met anyone who didn’t have ideas. The world is stuffed
with them. New ones, tired ones, radical ones, clever ones, good
and great ones. What we need are fresh, big, bold questions. Give
someone an idea, and they will judge. Ask them a great question,
and they will grow. This year I celebrate 20 years of being
married to someone who, every day, teaches me more about love
than I knew the day before. I try just to live up to that and be
a good example for my two children, encouraging them to ask
good questions. And with any luck, on a really good day, our cat
will notice that I exist.
