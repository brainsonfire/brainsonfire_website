		While it’s truly inspiring to receive so many inquires from so many great companies and causes interested in working with Brains on Fire, the reality is that we have only so many hours in a day, week and month to work our magic and do that thing we do in that way we do it. We are, by design, a small company. We believe that a tight and lean team gives us the ability to create meaningful, artisanal-quality work while really getting to know our clients on a deep, personal level. In short, we only take on a few new clients each year. And we take this decision seriously.
		</p>
		<p>Just as we believe in being marketing matchmakers who connect companies and causes to the right customers, we employ the same philosophy to our own company. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="column">
		<p>When we are able to take on new work, we don’t just take on any client; we look for that special something that tells us we’ll be a perfect match. The factors we use to spot a great fit run the gamut, taking into consideration your brand’s needs, your mission and your resources, as well as our strengths and availability. 
		</p>
		<p>We want to be certain we’re spending our time working with organizations we know we can help succeed—and can have fun with along the way. In order to do just that, we’ve developed a process that helps us determine that this is going to be a match made in marketing heaven.
